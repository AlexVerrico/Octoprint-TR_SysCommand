# ThermalRunaway System Command

An extension for the [ThermalRunaway](https://github.com/AlexVerrico/Octoprint-ThermalRunaway) plugin for OctoPrint to allow calling of system commands when a Thermal Runaway event is detected.

## Setup

Install manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/AlexVerrico/Octoprint-TR_SysCommand/archive/master.zip


## Configuration

The plugin settings page provides the necessary information as to what each option is for.  
This plugin also creates a new tab with buttons to manually trigger the configured commands to check whether they work as expected.

## Logs

Any output generated by the configured commands will be stored in the directory `<Octoprint base directory>/data/TR_SysCommand/`

# Disclaimer

This plugin effectively allows any user of your OctoPrint instance to call system commands as if they have SSH access to the machine.  
In addition to that, no command validation is performed by the plugin, so it is entirely possible to break your OctoPrint installation if you are not careful.
