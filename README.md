## Configuration

The plugin settings page provides the necessary information as to what each option is for.

# Disclaimer

This plugin effectively allows any user of your OctoPrint instance to call system commands as if they have SSH access to the machine.  
In addition to that, no command validation is performed by the plugin, so it is entirely possible to break your OctoPrint installation if you are not careful.
